/**
 * ESC from the handlebar remote (and any USB/BT keyboard): a short press runs
 * [onShortPress] — the screen's own "back", since Android doesn't route ESC to the back
 * dispatcher — while holding the key for [longPressTimeoutMs] or more runs [onLongPress]
 * instead.
 *
 * Both decisions are made on ACTION_UP from the key's own timestamps
 * (`eventTime - downTime`), **not** from the framework's `onKeyLongPress`. That callback
 * is delivered off the first key *repeat*, so it only ever arrives from an input device
 * that auto-repeats while held. The handlebar remote does not — it reports a plain down
 * and up — so the framework never reported a long press and holding ESC did nothing,
 * while the identical code worked from a USB keyboard. Measuring the gap ourselves
 * behaves the same on every device, which is the point: this action must not depend on a
 * capability of whatever is plugged in.
 *
 * [onKeyDown] still claims the DOWN and calls `startTracking()` — that is what makes the
 * UP arrive with `isTracking` set, which is how an UP whose DOWN went to another window
 * (a press that began before this one had focus) is told apart from a real press and
 * ignored. Both methods must be wired from the activity; there is no longer an
 * `onKeyLongPress` to wire.
 *
 * A remote that emits an instantaneous down/up pair on release, rather than holding the
 * key down, still cannot produce a long press — there is no elapsed time to measure. The
 * short press works either way.
